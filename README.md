# Full-Metadata Format
Dependency-free Python 2/3 support library for the Full-Metadata Format (FMF)

Version 1.0, currently, just writing FMF is possible.

All Python code that is needed at runtime is located in /python/dist.

To see how the library can be used look at the /python/test folder. Inside is one module with 
a lot of test cases that demonstrate the usage possibilities. In the file fmf.txt you have 
text that can be copied directly into a Python shell to run the test cases.

The easiest way for testing and exploring the library is to copy all content from /python/dist 
and /python/test into one single folder and run the text cases from IDLE.
